Short Description:
Reproducing Stanford CS224n NLP Architectures from Scratch + 2025–2026 Advanced Extensions | Word2Vec, RNN, LSTM, Attention, Transformers, Mini BERT, and Cutting-Edge Techniques

About This Repo
This repository is a complete learning and coding guide for modern NLP architectures. It is built upon the official Stanford CS224n syllabus, with extra advanced topics from recent NLP research (2025–2026).
The goal is to learn deeply, implement models from scratch, and maintain a research-level GitHub portfolio. All code is optimized to run on Kaggle or Colab free GPUs.
This is designed like a mini-book: each topic contains,Theory & Math Derivations.Step-by-Step Coding,Experiments & Results,Notes & Insights.

Core CS224n Topics
Word Representations
One-hot, Embeddings, Skip-gram, CBOW
Negative Sampling & Hierarchical Softmax
Code from scratch + experiment with small corpora
Neural Networks for NL
Vanilla RNN
LSTM & GRU
Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT)
Gradient checking and numerical verification
Sequence Modeling & Language Models
Training word-level & character-level models
Evaluating with Perplexity
Mini language model experiments
Attention Mechanisms
Basic attention & alignment
Scaled Dot-Product Attention
Multi-Head Attention
Transformer Architectures
Encoder & Decoder
Positional Encoding
Training from scratch on small datasets

5 Advanced Topics (2025–2026 Additions)
Miniature Pretrained BERT & GPT
Build small-scale transformers (~117M parameters)
Pretrain on a custom corpus
Fine-tune for tasks like sentiment or text classification
Efficient Attention & Memory-Saving Transformers
Implement Linformer / Performer style efficient attention
Reduce GPU memory usage on Colab/Kaggle
Multimodal NLP Inputs
Simple experiments combining text + images or audio
Example: Text captions → small image embedding
Evaluation Metrics Beyond Perplexity
BLEU, ROUGE, METEOR
Embedding similarity metrics for semantic evaluation
Practical Deployment & Optimization
Quantization, FP16 training
Export models to TorchScript or ONNX
Lightweight inference on CPU/Free Colab

Learning & Coding Workflow
1.Watch the Stanford CS224n lecture
2.Pause → Re-derive equations yourself
3.Code a minimal working version in Python/PyTorch
4.Push to GitHub + document results & insights
5.Experiment with advanced 2025–2026 techniques
